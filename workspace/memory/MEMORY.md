## Project Context

- **Context Compression**: [DONE] The system's built-in `Conversation Summary` is active and handling basic context management. No further custom script development is needed for now.
- **Vision Integration**: [PENDING] Spark is still "blind" to images and files. This is the next major hurdle.
